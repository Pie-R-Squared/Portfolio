        Having recently started university, I am a motivated and hard-working individual seeking a part-time job
        to do alongside my studies. I am considered highly competent by my peers and able to work to a high standard
        both independently and in a team. Furthermore, I can communicate and find solutions to customers needs, as
        I have done while working in retail during my gap year and volunteering at a charity shop.

        <h2 class="sections">SKILLS</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Coding skills</b> - Developed a game in python and completed a python online course. Designed a web page
                using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Completed various C++ and Java courses during my gap year. Writing programs
                requires a great deal of accuracy, and my university course involves lots of programming.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Communication</b> - While working at River Island, I had to constantly interact with customers to solve
                their issues, find products that suited them, and to find alternatives when their desired product was
                unavailable. Communicating with colleagues was also essential to make sure tasks were completed on time
                and to ensure every customer was tended to by a staff member.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Team-work</b> - This was vital when I was working in retail. My colleague and I had to process upwards
                of 800 units of clothing and non-clothing products, adding security tags to each unit, dividing stock onto
                rails or totes and sending them to the sales floor. While volunteering at a charity shop, I had to work at
                a fast pace with other volunteers and communicate information effectively.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Problem-solving</b> - Developing a python game entailed lots of problem solving and debugging. At River
                Island, I had to quickly sort through and process hundreds of deliveries and assist in finding/scanning
                missing stock.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Time Management</b> - I have demonstrated this by being incredibly punctual both in school, while
                volunteering and at work. I have always arrived at work on time or early. Moreover, I am very good at meeting
                deadlines and working under pressure. I am also able to complete the work to a high standard, as I have done
                during my A levels
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Technology</b> - Having used a large range of different devices, ranging from phones and computers to
                emulator software and till systems, I am able to learn how to operate new systems very quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Adaptability</b> - As well as being flexible, I am quite adaptable and can adjust myself and my work to
                meet requirements.
            </li>

        <h2 class="sections">EXPERIENCE</h2>
        <p><span class="experience">Sales Advisor</span> - <i>River Island</i></p>
        <p class="timeframe">December 2022 - August 2023</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                My main job was to process deliveries, usually with another team member. On Tuesdays and Fridays, a large
                delivery containing between 700 and 1000 units would arrive. My colleague and I would start by examining the
                contents of each box, sorting them into stacks for each department e.g. Men, Women, Kids, Non-clothing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then we would remove the packaging and add the security tags to each item. These were then hung onto rails or
                packed into totes and sent to the sales floor.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shop floor work included going up to customers and asking if they needed assistance, offering to check the
                stockroom for more sizes or ordering a specific size online.
            </li>
            <li>
                I would sell items at the till, which involved de-tagging the security tags, neatly folding and bagging the
                items. If customers returned items, I would put it through the system either as an in-store or Web refund,
                depending on the type of purchase.
            </li>
            <li>
                This required being till-trained, something that I would often refer to, in order to make sure I was always
                aware of how to operate every feature on the till.
            </li>
            <li>
                Other training included fire, health and safety and the data protection modules.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="experience">Volunteering</span> - <i>Mary's Living and Giving Shop for Save The Children</i></p>
        <p class="timeframe">October 2022 - June 2023</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Entailed a lot of work around the shop and in the storage area.
            </li>
            <li>
                From selling items at the counter and sorting out stock on the shop floor, to tagging large volumes of
                clothing in the storage area.
            </li>
            <li>
                After tagging items, I often used a steamer on all the clothing items.
            </li>
            <li>
                A lot of communication was required to keep up with the fast pace, and to create a welcoming environment
                for customers.
            </li>
            <li>
                To deal with the large number of customers, particularly in the mornings, I would usually assist my
                colleagues at the counter or around the shop.
            </li>
        </ul>
